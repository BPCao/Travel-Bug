Travel Bug

This application uses the National Park Service (NPS) API to get a brief description about parks or campgrounds (ordered by closest location using a geocode API), and saving it to a user's favorites.


Features

Users must register through the website (deployed through heroku) and after logging in, can search by city and state to find a list of parks or places to add to a favorites list.
